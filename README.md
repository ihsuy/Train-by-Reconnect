> **Abstract:** What makes untrained deep neural networks (DNNs) different from the trained performant ones? By zooming into the weights in well-trained DNNs, we found that it is the *location* of weights that holds most of the information encoded by the training. Motivated by this observation, we hypothesized that weights in DNNs trained using stochastic gradient-based methods can be separated into two dimensions: the location of weights, and their exact values. To assess our hypothesis, we propose a novel method called *lookahead permutation* (LaPerm) to train DNNs by reconnecting the weights. We empirically demonstrate LaPerm's versatility while producing extensive evidence to support our hypothesis: when the initial weights are random and dense, our method demonstrates speed and performance similar to or better than that of regular optimizers, e.g., *Adam*. When the initial weights are random and sparse (many zeros), our method changes the way neurons connect, achieving accuracy comparable to that of a well-trained dense network. When the initial weights share a single value, our method finds a weight agnostic neural network with far-better-than-chance accuracy.

## Steps to load the pre-trained weights
1. Locate the weight's corresponding jupyter-notebook in [notebooks](./notebooks). For example, for the weight named `Conv7.h5`, please look for [Conv7.ipynb](./notebooks/Conv7.ipynb) for the model definition and experiment configurations.
2. Define the `model` as demonstrated in the notebook.
3. Load the weights to `model` by
    ```python
    model.load_weights('../pretrained/Conv7.h5')
    ```
